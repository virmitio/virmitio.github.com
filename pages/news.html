<p>The <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Overview/SummerofCode">Outercuve GSoC ideas Page</a></p>

<p>What we need: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Students to build code!</strong> Please get the word out that CoApp (and Opensource on Windows in general) needs students for GSoC . <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">Student applications start March 26th</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mentors</strong> -- I've got 3 or 4 folks already volunteered; if we get a few students, we may need more. Anyone who can act as a mentor, I'd ask that you <strong><a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">APPLY IMMEDIATELY</a></strong> so we can show strong support for our project. Request to be a Mentor for the Outercurve Foundation. (Mention <em>"Garrett told me to tell you that I'm applying as a mentor for the CoApp project"</em>  in the message)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More Ideas</strong> -- We can always use more ideas of things to build for #CoApp ... (not just making shallow-forks), but some new innovative tools.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Student applications open March 26th (four days from now!)</p>

<p>We need action on this ASAP. </p>

<p>The More Students and Ideas we have, the more slots we should be able to get!</p> </div>

<hr>
    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>One of CoApp's recommended Google Summer of Code ideas is a <a href="http://www.outercurve.org/Overview/SummerofCode">CoApp Package Maker GUI (Reference #2012-001)</a>. Currently package creation is performed with the autopackage which takes .autopkg files as input. Creating these .autopkg files can be rather daunting we intend the GUI tool to streamline the creation and management of these files.</p>

<p>To help students interested in GSoC (and anyone else new to the project), I'm creating a set of tutorials teaching the basics of autopackage. I'll start with preparing your development system and creating very simple packages in this post.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Autopackage currently has a few requirements outside of the CoApp ecosystem. You'll need to install these requirements before moving forward:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/75656">WiX Toolset v 3.6 Beta</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279">Windows SDK v7.1</a></li>
</ol>

<p class="alert-message block-message success">
    While not explicitly required yet, it's highly recommended that you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/"> install Git</a> at this time as well.
</p> 

<p>After installing those, we have your system ready for Autopackage. Autopackage is part of the CoApp.Devtools package and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://coapp.org/pages/packages.html">CoApp package directory</a>. Download this file and follow the installation prompts.</p>

<h3>Creating a signing certificate</h3>

<p>All CoApp packages are required to be signed. In order to create a package, you need to have a code signing certificate. A simple shell script used for creating a test code signing certificate is available as a CoApp package called MakeTestCert.</p>

<p>To install MakeTestCert, run the following command at an administrator command prompt:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>coapp install maketestcert
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>Now we're going to create a test certificate. Once MakeTestCert is installed, open the Windows Sdk Command Prompt as an administrator. Once there navigate to a folder where you'd like to place your test certificate and type:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>MakeTestCert <span class="s2">&quot;test_cert&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>You'll be asked for a password, which is used to protect the private key for signing. Once you've entered a password and the command is complete. There will be two files created in the folder called "test_cert.cer" and "test_cert.pfx."  The first one just contains the public key and the second contains the public and private key and is used for signing packages. We'll need this later! </p>

<p>Next let's make sure the key is added to the trusted root authorities on the computer. Run the following command:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>certmgr.exe /add test_cert.cer /s /r localMachine root
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>This places your test certificate into the root of your certificate store on your computer. Additionally, your </p>

<h3>Creating the sample package</h3>

<p>Download the <a href="https://github.com/ericschultz/MakeTestCert/zipball/sample">sample package</a> and extract it. </p>

<p class="alert-message block-message success">
    You could use git to clone the repository at (<a href='https://github.com/ericschultz/MakeTestCert/'><a href='https://github.com/ericschultz/MakeTestCert/'>https://github.com/ericschultz/MakeTestCert/</a></a>).
</p> 

<p>This is a simplified source for the MakeTestCert package we installed earlier. In the root, you'll find a set of files and folders. Ignoring the readme and the files and folders used by Git, we have one file, MakeTestCert-Sample.cmd. This is the main shell script used by MakeTestCert.</p>

<p>You'll also see the COPKG directory. In the root of the source of every coapp package, you'll find a COPKG directory. This contains the information necessary to build and create the package. Inside that folder is one file, in this case called MakeTestCert.autopkg, which defines a package. Let's open that file for editing.</p>

<p>.autopkg files have a syntax similar to CSS files. In future posts, I'll discuss what all the rules mean but for now let's do a simple modification to the file to get our feet wet. Find the following line:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">publisher</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;YOURNAME&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>Since you're the creating the package, you might as well get some credit as the publisher. :) Replace YOURNAME with your actual name and save the file.</p>

<p>Now that we've finished the autopkg file, let's build the actual package. Navigate back to the root and run the following command:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>autopackage COPKG<span class="se">\M</span>akeTestCert.autopkg --certificate-path<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;PATH\TO\test_cert.pfx&quot;</span> --password<span class="o">=</span>PASSWORD_YOU_USED_BEFORE --remember
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>After the  command complete (it takes a while the first time while autopackage finds WiX), you will have a file called MakeTestCert-SAMPLE-1.0.0.0-any.msi in the COPKG directory. This is your package! Run this MSI and you'll install you're personally created copy of MakeTestCert-SAMPLE. Since the autopkg file puts MakeTestCert-SAMPLE, you can run MakeTestCert-SAMPLE from any command prompt.</p>

<p class="alert-message block-message success">
The --remember argument isn't required but you'll probably want to use it. Why you ask? --remember saves the certificate and your password  into the registry (in an encrypted form of course) for use by autopackage and a few other CoApp tools. Once you've used --remember, you won't have to provide a certificate path or password in the future for tools that need them. In that case you could run
<br/>
<br/>
<code>
autopackage COPKG\MakeTestCert.autopkg
</code>
</p> 

<p class="alert-message block-message success">
Normally, Autopackage can be run from any command prompt but a bug in the CoApp engine requires Autopackage to be run from an elevated command prompt. This bug should be fixed in the next week.
</p>

<h3>Where do I go from here?</h3>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I will have additional tutorials that describe more features of Autopackage. In the mean time, play around with autopackage and look at the .autopkg files used by CoApp and by the packages in the <a href="https://github.com/coapp-packages">coapp-packages organization</a>. Additionally feel free to email me at (<a href='mailto:<a href='mailto:wwahammy@gmail.com'>wwahammy@gmail.com</a>'><a href='mailto:wwahammy@gmail.com'>wwahammy@gmail.com</a></a>), contact me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/wwahammy">@wwahammy</a> or visit our <a href="http://coapp.org/developers/irc.html">IRC channel</a>. Feel free to ask questions! We know CoApp can be a bit daunting (that's why we have the GSoC projects!) and we're very interested in helping!</p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p><strong><a href="http://coapp.org/news/2012-02-17-Preview-of-CoApp-GUI---Part-1.html">Part 1 of CoApp GUI preview</a></strong></p>

<p>Today I'm going to summarize the mockup work I've completed on the general package manager for CoApp. Before I start, it's important to understand a few design decisions and the reasons for them.</p>

<p>During the design of the UI, the general package manager is both a package manager and something more broad, what we call a product manager. As you may recall, a CoApp package is uniquely identified by a name, a processor architecture, a version number and the public key token of the publisher. For certain advanced uses, a user might need this information but for most uses a user just wants a particular piece of software and to have it updated, ie: you want the latest version of Firefox and I want it to stay updated. For this purpose we have a simpler view of a set of packages from the same publisher with the same name which we call a "product." Most interactions with the CoApp GUI is with software at the product level instead of the package level. This isn't to say that interacting directly with packages isn't allowed or easy to do, a user certainly can and it's straightforward to do. </p>

<p>As we walk through the screenshots, you'll notice the similarity to the Windows App Store. This is not coincidental for a few reasons. First by making it as similar as possible to one of the primary methods of software distribution on Windows 8 we feel users will feel at home working with CoApp. Second, we know the App Store design has gone through numerous usability studies and redesign to become as straightforward for the end user. Considering we have very few resources to perform that kind of research, it seems practical to utilize the research that's already been performed.</p>

<p>With all that out of the way, let's get to the screenshots and walk through of the GUI.</p>

<p><em>Note: logos are used for illustration purposes only. While we certainly hope all of the open source projects illustrated will have CoApp packages, this isn't intended to indicate that they necessarily will.</em></p>

<h1>Product/Package Manager</h1>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/homepage.png" alt="Home screen of the product manager" title="" /></span></p>

<p>This is the home screen of the product manager that the user will see when they start the software. In fitting with Metro principles, the list of groups scroll left to right. The groups come from two places. First each package will be required to set a category. Secondly the user can use the Add a Feed button on the top right (or from the Setting screen) to add more feed urls. These feed URLs will be added to the home screen. Not shown is a link near the top right that would shows the user all installed products.</p>

<h2>Universal Search</h2>

<p>Not visible is that search is pervasive throughout the GUI. Simply typing begins a search (as long as a textbox doesn't have focus of course) or continues a search . In fact the search screen is reused for the installed products screen and the screen for showing all products in a category and from a feed.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/games.png" alt="Games/Search screen" title="" /></span></p>

<p>The screenshot above illustrates the design of the search screen, in this case it's showing all products in the Games categories. Above the list of products are filters (no the filter doesn't really do anything in the mockup :). CoApp utilizes a filtering concept we're calling "frictionless filtering." To add a filter, the user presses the the create filter button with the plus on the right side of the list of filters. After pressing the button a menu drop down with a list of possible attributes that a user can filter based on and an appropriate UI elements to create a filter for the given attribute. Once the user creates a filter, the filter replaces the button that was originally pressed. A new create filter button is created to the right of all the filters. To delete a filter, the user presses one of the previously created filters. The system is straightforward, intuitive and extremely powerful.</p>

<p>Once the user clicks on a product, the following screen will be displayed:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/product.png" alt="Product screen" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Should the user click the name of the publisher or one of the contributors, a bit of UI will be display providing information about the selected entity:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/contributor.png" alt="Contributor information" title="" /></span></p>

<p>When the user sees the details tab, it will look like so:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/productdetails.png" alt="Details" title="" /></span></p>

<p>The details tab provides more advanced information that the user might be interested in. Selecting one of the package versions will send the user to the screen for that package.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/productreviews.png" alt="Reviews" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Reviews for products are actually a combination of reviews for every package in a product. New reviews for a product are considered reviews of the latest package. This allows users to handle reviews in a way that feels natural but still provides all users with package level feedback should they want it. The slider above the reviews allows the user to filter based on how recent the reviewed version is.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/installpopup.png" alt="Installing Product" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Installing a product with dependencies will ask the user whether they want to all the dependencies of the product. As you can see in the upper right corner, there is a link, in this case titled "4 packages installing"  to see what packages are being installed. If there is an error during installation, the link will note that an error occurred, turn red and an exclamation point will slowly flash next to the link.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/installblocked.png" alt="Install Blocked" title="" /></span></p>

<p>If a product or one of it's dependencies is blocked, the user will be asked to unblock the blocked packages.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/packagedetails.png" alt="Package details" title="" /></span></p>

<p>On the package page, the details tabs show slightly different information that the user might want to know versus the product page. Specifically, the license for the package is shown and which versions this package is binary compatible with.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/installing.png" alt="Installing screen" title="" /></span></p>

<p>The installing screen is again available from pressing the link in the top right hand corner of the application.</p>

<h1>Again, this looks neat but when do I get it?</h1>

<p>The current timeline is to have this full GUI available for the release candidate which is around 8 weeks out.</p>

<p>Any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

<hr>
    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>Over the past few weeks, I've begun working full-time on creating a lo-fi mockup of the CoApp GUI as the beginning of my work on the GUI. At this point, I feel it's appropriate to share what's been accomplished, where we intend the GUI to going and how long I anticipate that taking. </p>

<p>The mock up was made in Sketchflow in Expression Blend. Sketchflow provides us with a good enough idea of how the interface might work but it has low enough fidelity that we don't get mired in minute design details. This is not the final product but it gets us in that direction.</p>

<p>The GUI consists of two major parts: an update client and the general package manager. This post will focus on the update client, while a future post will discuss the package manager.</p>

<h1>Update Client</h1>

<p>The update client is used to automate updates and upgrades of CoApp installed software. The update client follows a schedule and runs regularly in order to update CoApp software when needed in much the same way as Windows Update. Indeed, its user interface is very similar to Windows Update. The primary purpose of this is to put users at ease when they use the CoApp Updater.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/coappupdatingchecking.png" alt="The home screen of the CoApp Updater" title="" /></span></p>

<p>A user can get into CoApp Updater in a couple of ways. First they could manually start CoApp Updater if they were interested in checking if any updates existed for their software. Second when CoApp Update automatically runs in the background as scheduled it places a small icon in the system notification area. The user may double click that icon to open the CoApp Updater.</p>

<p>When user manually starts the CoApp Updater, the above screen is where they start. Once that's completed they go to the either a screen saying no packages are available or that packages are available.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/noupdates.png" alt="Your system is up to date" title="" /></span></p>

<p>The above screen shows when no package are available. The user can recheck for updates if they'd like. If there are updates, the user sees the following screen:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/updatesavailable.png" alt="There are packages available" title="" /></span></p>

<p>In this case, the user can either click on the link titled "5 updates available" to view the updates and upgrades or can press Install to install all the selected updates.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/selectupdates.png" alt="Select packages" title="" /></span></p>

<p>When the user views the updates they see the screen above. Again this is very similar to Windows Update. There are a few features that are not shown. One feature is that the user could block a particular update by right clicking on the name of the update. Additionally based upon community feedback during our conference call, I will be adding a method for the user to see which packages depend on a particular package to be updated. A user may want to know whether an updatable package, say OpenSSL, is used by another particularly vital package, say PHP. The user for whatever reason may want to verify that no packages used by PHP are ever updated. This allows the user to perform this verification.</p>

<p>When the user clicks install, the following screen is shown:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/guipreview/installingupdates.png" alt="Installing" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Again, this is very similar to the Windows Update installation screen.</p>

<h1>That's neat, but when do I get this?</h1>

<p>The update client is on a very aggressive schedule with the plan of having it committed into the main CoApp repository in about three weeks and to be officially released in the CoApp 1 RC.</p>

<p>Because of this timeline, if you want your suggestions added into the Updater for this initial release, time is of the essence! Please provide feedback as soon as possible on this post, the CoApp <a href="https://launchpad.net/~coapp-developers">mailing list</a>, the CoApp <a href="http://coapp.org/developers/irc.html">IRC channel</a> and/or directly to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/wwahammy">Twitter</a></p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>Recently, on the mailing list, Mateusz Loskot <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/coapp-developers/msg01234.html">asked the question</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps it has been discussed and solution's already established,<br />but I'm wondering how CoApp is going to solve dependencies between<br />packages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, get your pencils ready kids, 'cause I'm about to drop the knowledge hammer down.</p>

<p>CoApp (over the longer term) handles dependencies in two ways:</p>

<p><strong>Fixed</strong> dependencies and <strong>Flexible</strong> dependencies. Fixed dependencies are specific bindings to another package (Package <code>B-1.0.0.0-x86-AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD</code> requires Package <code>A-1.0.0.0-x86-DDDDEEEEFFFF1111</code>). Flexible dependencies are far more fluid, and simply state that "this package requires any package that satisfies <code>feature-XYZ</code> with a version matching range <code>NNNN</code>".</p>

<p><strong>Fixed</strong> dependencies are tied very tightly to how Windows' <a href="/news/2010-04-15-CoApp-FAQ-Can-you-explain-how-side-by-side-WinSxS-works.html" title="CoApp FAQ - Can you explain how Side-by-side (WinSxS) works?">Side-by-Side</a> technology works.  Each package has a <code>name</code> (e.g. <code>B</code>), <code>version</code> (e.g <code>1.0.0.0</code>), <code>platform architecture</code> (e.g. <code>x86</code>), and a <code>public-key-token</code> (e.g. <code>AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD</code>, which is calculated from the hash of the signing key of the package-publisher's certificate).  These create somewhat rigid requirements of other packages, where the only flexibility is that the publisher of a package can specify that a newer version of a package is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"><strong>binary-compatible</strong></a> with an older version, and should be used instead. In Windows, the binary-compatibility expressed by packages is called the <em>publisher-policy</em>. </p>

<p>In CoApp, we refer to this as the <strong>compatibility-policy</strong>. When a package asks for a version of a package, the package manager looks for the highest version of the package that satisfies the dependency, given the compatibility-policy. For example if a package binds to <code>zlib-1.2.0.0-x86-AAAABBBBCCCCDD</code> , and the highest binary-compatible package is <code>zlib-1.2.7.11-AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD</code> , CoApp will attempt to install the later package.  This does seem to place a great deal of trust in the publisher of a given package--but really, if you're trusting them by making a dependency on them, you should be trusting them to make sure that they are not breaking binary compatibility when they say they are not. Conversely, publishers should be <em>extremely careful not to break binary compatibility when publishing updates</em>. </p>

<p>
    <table class="zebra-striped condensed-table" style="width:;" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Things your OS never told you about version numbers</th><th></th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>You may have noticed that CoApp version numbers are always represented as a four 16-bit positive integers, containing <strong>[major-version].[minor-version].[build-number].[revision]</strong>. For example, version 1.5.1254.0 indicates 1 as the major version number, 5 as the minor version number, 1254 as the build number and 0 as the revision number.  Windows Side-by-Side technology (and it's sibling, .NET assemblies) <strong>requires</strong> this standard for versioning everything.  <br/><br/> When Side-by-side is asked to find an assembly of a given version, it first looks at just the <strong>[major-version].[minor-version]</strong> of the assembly, and checks to see if there is a publisher-policy for that version combination. If there are any policies found (as <a href="msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973843.aspx">there can be several</a>), it then checks the version ranges in the policy to see if the requested version has been redirected to a new one.<br/><br/> From this behavior, you can infer that the designers of SxS generally intended that binary-compatible libraries would be constrained to the same major/minor versions, as you'd have to explicitly create a policy for every major/minor version that you wish to redirect (which is possible, but not encouraged).  Those of us in the real world realize that controlling these numbers is not always as easy as that, so CoApp tries to make building policies bridging major/minor versions easier, and hides the details. </td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</p>

<p>When the package manager resolves the dependency tree where all the dependencies are <code>Fixed</code>, it does so in a predictable, fault-tolerant way.  By examining the publisher policies, it works it's way back from the <strong>most appropriate</strong> version down to the <strong>least appropriate</strong> version. The most appropriate is the highest version that has a compatibility-policy that covers the given version, and where that package's entire dependency tree can be satisfied. If a failure happens during the downloading of the dependencies, or during the installation of one of the dependencies, that package gets marked as <em>unable to be fulfilled</em> for that installation session, and the package manager starts back at the top, and tries to identify the best package that can be fulfilled. This form of dependency resolution is always straightforward and doesn't require any special judgement or decision making ability, since every installable package has a very explicit expectation of what it requires.</p>

<p>Some fundamental difference between CoApp and package management resolution systems found on other platforms:</p>

<p>
    <table class="zebra-striped condensed-table" style="width:;" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>CoApp packages <em>never</em> collide. Each and every package can be installed side-by-side with each other, and while one may be 'active' for purposes of a given configuration, the presence of another version of the same package can never result in the failure of it's sibling.</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>CoApp packages are always <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd40t7ad.aspx"><strong>strong named</strong></a>. With the <code>name</code>, <code>version</code>, <code>platform architecture</code> and <code>public-key-token</code>, no package can be poisoned/broken by installing a package from another publisher.</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>With no possibility of package collision or conflicts, we have no need to support negative conditions on package dependencies (ie, install <code>A</code> &amp; <code>B</code> unless <code>C</code> is installed.) This removes an order of complexity in package resolution.</td><td></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</p>

<p>We also have the ability to place markers on packages that affect resolution in a few ways:</p>

<p>
    <table class="zebra-striped condensed-table" style="width:;" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Markers</th><th></th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>    <tr><td></td><td></td><td><code>Requested</code> packages are packages that the user explicitly asked for. For example, I wanted to use OpenSSL-1.0.0.0 and it brought in zlib-1.2.5.0. OpenSSL is a requested package, zlib is not. When upgrading, a requested package can be upgraded to a newer version that may not be binary compatible (since you don't have a binary dependency you're breaking with installing a new one)</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td><code>Required</code> packages are packages that are the result of a dependency resolution. In the previous example, zlib is a required  package. These can be automatically be upgraded to a newer, binary-compatible package.</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td><code>Frozen</code> packages are ones that the user has specifically stated that it is not to be upgraded, for whatever reason</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td><code>Blocked</code> packages are ones that the user has specifically stated that it is not to be installed, for whatever reason</td><td></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</p>

<p><strong>Flexible</strong> dependencies on the other hand, are not yet implemented in CoApp, so even this definition is somewhat fluid. Generally, we're looking to make sure that we can have packages that simply state things like <em>"I need any version of a python interpreter"</em>, or <em>"I need a version of Java greater than Java 5"</em> .  Exactly how these are specified is still a topic for discussion, and I'm eagerly accepting ideas and feedback for how this plays out.</p>

<p>This is where it's going to get a little bit dicey, and we're going to have to build a set of rules to determine the most appropriate course of action.  </p>

<p>
    <table class="zebra-striped condensed-table" style="width:;" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Questions about happy package resolution</th><th></th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>When two packages can satisfy a Flexible dependency, and you have neither installed, how do you choose which one to install? This ranges from the very trivial <code>"I need any version of grep"</code> to <code>"I need a version of python 3.2+"</code> <br/><br/>What criteria can we use to satisfy these dependencies (especially when the publisher has absolutely no preference) </td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>CoApp prides itself (in the default case) of never requiring the user to make decisions for package satisfaction. Do we want to make it so that advanced users can be asked to choose a course for Flexible package resolution? </td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td>How do we set--or more appropriately, allow communities to--set standards for determining if a given package actually fulfills a given 'feature', and when in the event a package is found to not be adequately fulfilling a feature, how does the community push that feedback back to others? <br/><br/>Does this mean that a publisher should be able to say <code>"I want any Perl 5 implementation, but not *Cheesy-Perl*"</code> ? If so, what happens when we need to install a second Perl, just because a publisher didn't want or can't use the currently available one? Does that replace the 'active' installed Perl?  </td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</p>

<p>I've looked at resolver algorithms like <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Libzypp_satsolver_basics">Libzypp</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">general theories</a> on the subject, and they appear to solve issues that our philosophical boundaries generally eliminate (XOR and negative conditions are unnecessary). </p>

<p>The only other random thought I've had is that there may be cases where a dependency tree is already installed for a less-than-most-appropriate dependency tree, but the package manager would try to update as much as it can.  To me, this sounds like the packages are due for an update, but for whatever reason the user hasn't updated them. Should the package manager simply accept the given resolved dependency tree without additional installs, if possible?</p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>I've been feverishly trying to write documentation this week ... and at the same time enhancing the DocPad-powered cms engine that's powering the CoApp.org website.</p>

<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>Over the last couple of days I've tweaked the layout of the website, and I think it's really starting to come together. Thanks to everyone on IRC who gave their feedback!</p>

<h2>CMS Engine</h2>

<p>The site is a statically-generated website that is based off of DocPad, but over the course of the last few days, I've significantly enhanced it with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>switched to GitHub-Flavored-Markdown for the Markdown processor </p></li>
<li><p>added the missing triple-backtick (```) syntax-highlighting format for color syntax highlighting  of source code blocks (uses an online pygments webservice)  -- this means no javascript in the browser to do syntax highlighting :)</p></li>
<li><p>enhanced the markdown language with a few new items (turning this slowly into what I call 'garrett-flavored-markdown' ): </p></li>
<li><p>image embedding with overflow wrapper so the image gets a scrollbar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>![alt-text](image-url)</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>video embedding, embeds videos with H.264 and webm codecs for HTML5 and a fallback to flash:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>% [width,height,posterimageurl,mp4url,webmurl]</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>HTML anchor support (for embedding the target of an anchor) :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>[text](anchor-id)</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>the ability to smuggle links into color-syntax highlighted code (see the example on the page <a href='http://coapp.org/reference/cli.html'><a href='http://coapp.org/reference/cli.html'>http://coapp.org/reference/cli.html</a></a> -- click on the --help in the text):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>«somecode«href»</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stuff to look at!</h2>

<p>Please check out the developer articles I've started:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="/developers/git.html">Getting setup with Git and GitHub</a><br /><a href="/developers/development-environment.html">Setting up the development environment</a><br /><a href="/developers/source-code.html">Check out the source code</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the start of the reference work: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="/reference/cli.html">Common command-line reference</a> --  usage information that is common to all/most CoApp command line tools<br /><a href="/reference/ptk.html">ptk.exe</a> -- CoApp 'porting toolkit'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, I've started to make some 'standards' around what the content looks like, hopefully this will help people start to get a grip on the work that we've been doing.</p>

<p>I'd <strong>love</strong> your feedback, and even more, I'd love any help you can provide. </p>

<h2>Playing with the CMS:</h2>

<h3>The only tools you need to play with the CMS engine is a Git and a text editor. <strong>(Not notepad!)</strong></h3>

<p>You can clone the repository:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone git@github.com:coapp<span class="n">/coapp.org.git</span>
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>You can run the embedded mini-server by running the command:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">cd</span> coapp.org
server.cmd
</pre></div>

<p>

<blockquote>
  <p>don't worry about any error message right now<br />you might get a firewall popup. Say yah, it's ok<br />press ctrl-c to stop the server (when you're done, or it does something goofy)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From there, you should be able to see the website in a browser: <a href='http://localhost:9778/index.html'><a href='http://localhost:9778/index.html'>http://localhost:9778/index.html</a></a> </p>

<p>Modify files in the <code>./src/</code> directory and below, and the server will automatically regenerate the site (and beep when it's done)... Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>If you've been putting off getting involved, now is a good time! Come check out the content (yeah, there's lots of 404s yet!)  Feel free to fix them, put in placeholder pages, fix stuff, and send me a pull request on GitHub!</p>

<p>Turn lousy docs into good ones!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, ping me! Come to the IRC channel, just ... do SOMETHING!!</p>

<p>I thought this would be a good opportunity to set some expectations as to what features I think we are going to get done in what upcoming milestones.</p>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>As most people who know me, I'm a huge proponent of digital signing and strong naming of binaries.</p>

<p><strong>Authenticode digital signing</strong> is where the publisher of a peice of software gets a certificate from a CA (certificate authority) that allows them to attach a cryptographic signature to their binaries.  This <strong>doesn't</strong> tell you that it's safe, but as long as the publisher hasn't lost controlof their private key (and/or the CA hasn't been comprimised), you can be assured that the binary actually came from that publisher.</p>

<p><strong>.NET Strong Naming</strong> on the other hand, offers up something similar, yet designed for a different purpose.  When a developer strong-names an assembly, consumers of that assembly can link to it and know that when their application runs, it will only run with a copy of that assembly by that publisher, and not merely pick up one that conveniently has the same name.  In strong-naming, there is no CA (and hence, no assertion that the publisher is who they say they are), merely the ability to know that a given binary came from the same publisher as the last one. Oh year,.NET binaries can also be digitally signed, which provides the benefits of both sides of the cryptographic spectrum.</p>

<p>I've said it many times, CoApp is at this point, only supporting signed binaries (and .NET binaries must be strong-named as well.)  There are already a number of cheap/free places that open source projects can acquire code-signing certificates, and we'll be investigating how to cleanly support self-signed (or community-cross-signed) certificates in the future.  </p>

<p>Really, if you are a proponent of Open Source software, you'd really <strong>only</strong> want to run binaries that you haven't personally built if the publisher had digitally signed them, which would at least give you the satisfaction of being able to track down the publisher of a given binary.</p>

<h2>Using Code Signing and Strong Naming</h2>

<p>So that being said, there are a couple of things about Digital Signing that have irked me for a very long time.</p>

<p>First, code signing is a pain-in-the-backside.  The tools, documentation, compilers, etc seem to all be built by people who really didn't know how developers work in the real world, and/or by people who thought that having a really compilcated command line process was better than just doing the right thing in a simple, straightforward manner.  The process for code signing should be as simple as :</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>   <span class="n">BINARY</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CERTIFICATE</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">PASSWORD</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">Signed</span> <span class="n">Binary</span> 
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>What more do you <strong>really</strong> want to know about signing? Any more complicated than that, and you're losing developers. Which means that customers are losing too.</p>

<p>The second thing that irks me, is that <strong>strong-naming</strong> is even more of a pain-in-the-backside.  Not only is the process locked up in a single painful tool (sn.exe), the developers of .NET seem to have gone out of their way to explain it in such a way that makes sure everyone is just doing it all by rote. Worse, you have to make huge changes your development practice to support strong naming.</p>

<p>Because the assembly needs to be written to disk with the embedded signature, you have to either </p>

<p>(a) give all your developers access to your strong-name-private-key (which is downright stupid--that sort of thing should be kept under extremely tight control, and the release manager/project leaders should be the only ones with access)</p>

<p>(b) split out the public key, and use that during development (using what is called 'delay-signing'). Delay signing embeds the public key, and leaves space in the binary for the cryptographic hash, but  doesn't actually fill it in. Of course, then the binaries aren't <em>really</em> signed, and you have to turn off signature verification on the developer's machines which makes it so no .NET binaries are checking for signatures (oh, you can do it per-binary. WHAT A PAIN!). Anyone who has every worked under these conditions knows that this sucks so bad, that you don't want to do it. There is a third option-- .NET has an assembly attribute you can use to specify the strong-named public key, and you could use a compiler <code>#define</code> to only strong name it when you want to build the release version:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#if SIGN_ASSEMBLY </span>
<span class="na">    [assembly: AssemblyKeyFileAttribute(&quot;path\\to\\release-public-key.snk&quot;)]</span>
<span class="na">    [assembly: AssemblyDelaySignAttribute(true)]</span>
<span class="cp">#endif </span>
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>That's what I was doing with CoApp for a long time. Oh, yeah, they depricated that.  So there <em>isn't</em> an approved, non-deprecated way to only strong-name during release. On top of that, only I could build the release version,and I <strong>still</strong> had to contend with the final boneheaded part  of the whole equation:</p>

<p><strong>SN.EXE WON"T LET YOU PASS THE PASSWORD TO THE KEYPAIR ON THE COMMAND LINE</strong></p>

<p>There isn't a command line argument for it, it stops and prompts for it. Oh, and the binary checks to see if you are redirecting stdin and doesn't even let you do that.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I know that some well-meaning PM thought that this was a good idea, but if I want to make the decision to automate my development process by putting the password to my certificate or strong-named <strong>IT'S MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>*I've got an extremely long and complicated password on my machines. I've got a screen-saver lock that engages after a couple minutes. I've got Bitlocker on my drive. I don't need another layer  of pseudo-security pretending to 'help' ... *</em></p>

    <p>By the way, yes I do know that you can have sn.exe manage the keypair for you, but you'll get pretty dissatisfied with that too.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, here we sit with essentially a very valuable concept, wrapped in irksome developer tools, and a flawed process. Final Verdict: EVERYONE HATES TO DO STRONG NAMING.</p>

<h2>So, I fixed all that.</h2>

<p>CoApp's <em>simplesigner</em> tool (and, by extension, <em>autopackage</em>) can now strong name and sign <strong>ANY .NET binary</strong> without having to resort to any goofiness.  It can rewrite assembly attributes on the fly, and insert a new strong name for .NET assebmlies, as well as generate and embed and digital signatures for native and .NET binaries with a single command.  You can leave the certificate in a .pfx fileand it will use the same keypair for signing and strong naming. you can pass the password on the  command line, or have it remember it in an encrypted setting in the user's registry (which can only be decrypted when that user is logged in, and can't be recovered if the user's password is forcibly changed)</p>

<p>It doesn't use command line tools behind the scenes to do its work (a solution I had cobbled together before) nor does it use such things as ILMerge (which was one way to sneak in a new strong name after the fact)</p>

<h2>Example usage:</h2>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/simplesigner.png" alt="Running simplesigner on an EXE" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Pretty easy, eh? Notice that it also signed and strong-named the dependent Assemblies. If you wanted to use a different public key, you could just do that beforehand.</p>

<p>We can also check PEVerify to ensure that the updated files are all happy-as-a-clam .NET EXEs:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/verified.png" alt="Running PEVerify on the result" title="" /></span></p>

<p>And of course, you can see the EXE is digitally signed:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/DigitallySigned.png" alt="Verifying that it's signed" title="" /></span></p>

<h2>How did I accomplish this strange dark magic?</h2>

<p>Tons of research into the public APIs for digital signing and strong naming (yeah, everything I've done, is documented <strong>somewhere</strong> ... ) and levereaged the <a href="http://ccimetadata.codeplex.com/">cci-metadata project</a> from Microsoft Research on codeplex.</p>

<p>CCI-Metadata lets you manipulate .NET binaries, which I used to add in the strong name public key, and after persisting it back to disk, I was able to use the MSCOREE apis to apply the strong-name itself.</p>

<p>I'll see about doing a deep-dive into the code soon. When CoApp Beta 2 is posted in a couple weeks, the simplesigner tool will be there, and you'll be able to just grab that binary and use it foryour own codesigning and strong-naming work.</p> </div>

<hr>
    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>As we approach getting to Beta 2 for CoApp (and hear that expected date whizz past!), <br />it's probably a good idea that I drop a quick update as to where we are.</p>

<p>Our CoApp-as-a-Win32-Service work is pretty much complete (although I'd like to do a full <br />security review before 1.0).  We have the full functionality of the engine provided over <br />a named-pipes connection, and it's working pretty darn well.  The engine actually performs <br />significantly better that when it was in-process with the client, and really, supports a few <br />more features that before as well--support for fine-granularity group-policy-controlled<br />permissions for CoApp functionality, multiple concurrent clients, faster installation, better feed <br />management, package blocking, trim support, zero-reboot support for environment variables and more.</p>

<p>We're also addressing the UI perspective as well--the CoApp bootstrapper (the embedded bit<br />that is stuck inside every single package) sports a clean and clear UI:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/xp-bootstrap.png" alt="Bootstrapping CoApp on XP" title="" /></span></p>

<p>Even when the bootstrapper fails, it's not too complicated :</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/bootstrap-fail.png" alt="What happens when things don't go right..." title="" /></span></p>

<p>(Ok, I borrowed from "Windows 8" on that one...)</p>

<p>As well, the default installer (what you see when you simply double-click on a CoApp MSI) is nearly done:</p>

<p class="ScrollImage"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/doqU_HPrLqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be software development if there wasn't a couple of bumps in the road. <br /><br />Extensive debugging of the bootstrap process and a few other bits has taken a bit longer than <br />I was hoping, but we're coming down to the last couple of weeks of effort, and we should have a <br />pretty stable and usable Beta 2 build, which will certainly allow us to start packaging up <br />some software.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the bugs will start rolling in like crazy after that!</p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>A little close to short notice, but as we're getting close to the end of August, <br />I thought we should do a sprint to get a bunch more shallow-forks done.</p>

<p>So for this weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), I'm going to spend as much time <br />online on IRC and Lync (and Skype if needs be) to give live assistance to anyone doing shallow forks.</p>

<p>As well, for every person that submits at least one shallow fork, I'll give two bonuses: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Double their points/entries earned this weekend in the final draw for the prizes.</strong><br><br></li>
<li><strong>Let them pick one of the third-level prizes to get right away (any one item from XBox live subscription, 4000 Microsoft points, Xbox Controllers, Xbox Headsets ,Arc Keyboards, Sidewinder Keyboards, One of serveral XBox games, ... I think there is a few more things in there too!)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>So, yeah, come join us on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#coapp">IRC</a> and/or on the <strong>online conference call:</strong></p>

<p>You can dial-in or use the free Lync client:</p>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>After what seems like an eternity and a half to get to this point, I am proud to announce that the first CoApp packages are finally here!</p>

<p>I've started by packaging up the CoApp installer itself as a CoApp package, and you can <a href="http://coapp.org/install">download that</a> , but it's not <em>really</em> necessary, as CoApp will install itself when you install any CoApp package. </p>

<p>The next package that's ready is the first beta of the CoApp developer tools, this release contains the following tools:</p>

<p><em>autopackage.exe</em> -- the CoApp packaging tool ... while it's a bit rough around the edges (like most of the tools) it's what I've been using to build packages so far (<em>note: it requires a recent build of WiX to be installed</em> to actually work)</p>

<p><em>ptk.exe</em> -- the CoApp porting toolkit tool -- we use this to do our shallow forks</p>

<p><em>dllimport.exe</em> -- a tool for creating C exports from .NET assemblies ... I should really document this :D</p>

<p><em>quicktool.exe</em> -- a quick little tool for posting source snippets, images and shortening URLs... Again, I should probably document that tool so others could use it.</p>

<p>These tools can be found in the <a href="http://coapp.org/devtools">coapp.devtools package</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, because I'm such a big Node.js fan, a CoApp package for <a href="http://coapp.org/cdn/node-0.5.2.0-x86.msi">node.js 0.5.2</a></p> </div>

  <blockquote>

Symlinks are a critical part of CoApp's design, and I'm not willing<br />to compromise the features thatrely on them...</p>

<p>Having looked at a <a href="https://github.com/coapp/coapp.org/wiki/Coapp-engine---engine-as-a-service-redesign">few ways to overcome this limitation</a>, we've pretty much settled on the idea<br />that we will split up some of the CoApp components into finer-grained pieces, and create a service that can perform<br />the requisite high-privilege operations that are needed to for CoApp to manage packages correctly.</p>

<p>This involves taking the CoApp Toolkit library, and splitting into two pieces--the components that we need for the higher-privileged service<br />(becoming the Toolkit Core) and components that have more general purpose (the Toolkit Client). The same goes for the the Engine library itself,<br />being split into the Engine Core, and the Engine Client. It's likely that most of the functionality will still reside in the<br />Engine core, and the Engine Client is there to facilitate the use of the Core.</p>

<p>A lightweight Win32 Service EXE is created to host the Engine Core itself.</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/service.png" alt="service components" title="" /></span></p>

<p>The communication between the client and service pieces of CoApp will use a simple bidirectional interface over named pipes, which will <br />make it pretty trivial to automate the CoApp engine from pretty much any language on Windows.</p>

<p>In some ways, this is actually a mixed blessing. Migrating part of CoApp itself into a Win32 service was a longer-range goal I've had, as it provides a few things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>-- Lets us create symlinks from an MSI install.<br><br /> -- Limits even further the actual amount of code running at an elevated level.<br><br /> -- Ensures all the network communication into userspace where it can happen at a lower privilege and take advantage of the user's network settings<br><br /> -- we can decide what features "require" the user to be elevated (so, updates can be configured to install without direct user elevation)<br></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This does of course come at an increased price; we not only need to do the appropriate refactoring necessary in CoApp engine and toolkit,<br />but now that we're adopting the Win32 Service model, we're going to also run a few components thru a very-fine-grained Security Audit.</p>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p><b><br />Sorry for the short notice, but I'm going to have a conference call this morning to talk about a problem that we’ve run into and how we’re going to solve it.<br /></b><br></p>

<p>We have to make some fundamental changes in the architecture of the CoApp engine to work around a problem discovered yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>The problem, is that when the user double-clicks on an a CoApp MSI, Windows Installer elevates the installer process by switching to the LOCALSYSTEM (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) account, but actively removes a bunch of privileges that they didn't figure an installer would need—specifically the ability to create symlinks has been removed.</p>

<p>Symlinks are a critical part of CoApp's design, and I'm not willing to compromise the features that rely on them.</p>

<p>The only way we can get from that crippled LOCALSYSTEM account to a real LOCALSYSTEM account is to create a Win32 service, and spin it up (which we can actually do from that crippled LOCALSYSTEM account), and have it do the work we need done.</p>

<p>Of course, doing this is a fundamental shift, and requires some careful thought and execution.</p>

<p>On the up side, I did anticipate going this direction at some point in the future (V2), so this could be a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>We can talk about this at the conf call at 10:30 AM PDT this morning.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome.<br />G</p>

<p><a href="http://githubissues.heroku.com/#coapp/toolkit">Github Issues Interface</a></p>

<p>This only seems to work in Chrome, but it's a really nice interface to the GitHub issue tracker.</p>

<p>Some helpful hints:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Click on the login to GitHub link at the bottom left hand corner.</p>

    <p>It saves your repositories that you are watching when you close the window, so if you open a second window, you won't see the repositories you’ve added unless the first one is closed before. And it's last-closed-window-wins (so close the window with the watched repositories you care about last!).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also a nice <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlphmcafjfbcoagfoanfaljdmkcimhmi">Chrome extension</a> that makes it easy to link to the fancy interface from the standard gitub issues page: </p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>After a break of nearly a month, I'm back in the CoApp groove, and now it's finally time to announce our summer coding contest!</p>

<h2>The Stick-A-Fork-In-CoApp contest</h2>

<p>Our goal over the summer is to generate a whole slew of nice, clean shallow forks <br />that we can use both as test cases for completing the packaging tools as well as producing <br />the packages for general consumption.</p>

<p>I've managed to get our sponsors (the Outercurve Foundation and Microsoft) to donate some prizes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Two</strong> XBOX 360 Arcade with Kinect + games bundles<br><br /><strong>Three</strong> Kinect 3d Motion Controllers<br><br /><strong>Lots</strong> of XBox 360 Games (list coming soon)<br><br /><strong>Lots</strong> of XBox Live Subscriptions<br><br /><strong>Lots</strong> of XBox Live Points cards<br><br />Microsoft Keyboards (Arc Keyboard, Sidewinder Keyboard)<br> <br />Microsoft Arc Mice<br><br />T-Shirts<br></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We're hoping to hit about 200 shallow-forks this summer, which will be an<br />awesome start to getting a lot of top-notch open source software running on Windows.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can get entries into the contest for filing or fixing bugs as well as filling in documentation for the CoApp project</p>

<p>Tim is a new full time employee at Microsoft who started this week, and as he just found out yesterday (his first day in the office), is going to be working as a full-time test resource for CoApp.</p>

<p>Tim has a few words about himself;</p>

<p>></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Tim Rogers</em> is new to Microsoft, fresh out of college.  He has been living in Iowa, attending Iowa State University.  Major interests include technical theater, bicycles, strategy games, and reading.  Tim insists that he is a boring and unimaginative person, so throwing rocks and other things at him is to be encouraged.  This bio was written by the aforementioned boring and unimaginative person.</p>

  <p>Feel free to adjust or make things up to your hearts content."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, Tim likes to talk about himself in the third person.</p>

<p>Tim is going to start by tackling the orchestration and test writing for the CoApp engine &amp; the component that gets the most end-user exposure.</p>

<p>As he gets up to speed, he'll likely start blogging and filling in the documentation where he can as well.</p>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>We're nearing the point where we're able to take open source projects and produce happy-shiny packages for them--uh yeah, <em>nearing</em>. <br /><br />It's gonna be a couple more weeks shaking out the tools that generate new Visual Studio project files for a given project and wire all that stuff up.</p>

<p>The good news though, is that we're ready to have people start shallow-forking projects and sticking them into <a href="http://github.com/coapp-packages">GitHub</a>. </p>

<h2>What's a "shallow-fork" you say?</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://bit.ly/lGYOb6">fork</a> happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and starts independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software.  A shallow-fork is when the independent development continually brings forward changes from the original project, and attempts not to stray very far from it.  We do this so that we can make appropriate Windows changes (like new build scripts, or better API support) keep compatibility and not break the original project.  If the upstream project is willing to accept changes, great! If not (for whatever reason)... great! Either way, the package maintainer for the CoApp project will aim to keep the projects in sync as much as possible. </p>

<p>Linux distributions do this sort of thing all the time, in order to build packages for their specific version of Linux.  We're essentially following in the same footsteps, but following the procedure that I'm setting out here, so that we can eventually produce packages of software for CoApp.</p>

<h2>Can You Help?</h2>

<p>We're looking for people to start the leg-work for building packages right now, this means creating a fork in GitHub, and doing the work to get it compiling under Windows no matter how it's done (i.e., you can use a makefile, VS project files, a batch file... whatever). The idea is to just get a successful build that can be replicated on a known configuration--Visual Studio 2010 (even <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/">VS 2010 express</a>), and the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/6/A/A6AC035D-DA3F-4F0C-ADA4-37C8E5D34E3D/winsdk_web.exe">Windows SDK 7.1</a> ... We'll be automating the work later that creates well-built VS 2010 project files (and eventually other builds like mingw, etc), but that work will leverage the effort done now to create consistent shallow-forks.</p>

<h2>What do you need?</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The aforementioned Visual Studio 2010 (the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/">express</a> version will do), and the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/6/A/A6AC035D-DA3F-4F0C-ADA4-37C8E5D34E3D/winsdk_web.exe">Windows SDK 7.1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/signup/free">An account on GitHub</a>, and the ability to check stuff in (you can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/">tortoisegit</a> , or any other Git client for Windows even the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/">Mercurial</a> plugin <a href="http://hg-git.github.com/">hg-git</a>, which lets you use Git repositories as if they were mercurial repositories. <em>(Note: I tried the hg-git plugin, and had to use the version <a href="https://github.com/sampsyo/hg-git">here</a> to get it to work)</em></p></li>
<li><p>The ability to build software using Visual Studio we need command line builds, but if you get it working from inside the IDE, we can show you how to automate that from the command line in a single step.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to follow the pretty-darn-simple process below to produce the necessary build.</p></li>
<li><p>A current build of the CoApp tools. You can <a href="http://fearthecowboy.com/2011/04/26/weve-moved-coapp-code-hosting-to-github/">compile them yourself</a>, or just download my <a href="http://cdn.coapp.org/files/coapp-tools-snapshot.zip">latest snapshot build</a>. Make it easy on yourself, put them in a folder that's in the %PATH%.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Becoming a package maintainer</h2>

<p>The first thing is to get yourself added as a CoApp package-maintainer on GitHub no worries, signing up for this isn't a lifelong commitment. If you are interested in keeping it moving over the long haul, that's great, but even if you can just do up a few projects and get them checked in, we'll figure out the long term maintenance strategy later.</p>

<p>In order to get added to the package maintainer group you can send me a message on GitHub (fearthecowboy) or via <a href="mailto:<a href='mailto:<a href='mailto:garretts@microsoft.com'>garretts@microsoft.com</a>'><a href='mailto:garretts@microsoft.com'>garretts@microsoft.com</a></a>">email</a>, or heck, even just send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%2C+%40fearthecowboy%21+I%27d+like+to+become+a+%23CoApp+package+maintainer.+My+github+id+is+...">tweet</a>. All I need is your GitHub account id, and I'll add you to the group.</p>

<h2>Wait! Before You Begin...</h2>

<p>Since shallow-forking is intended to continually merge in changes from upstream, please keep changes to the project and its files to an absolute minimum don't do any unnecessary changes, don't reorganize the files, and don't try to rebuild a 'cleaner' build process.  You only need to get it to the point where it builds a viable output.  As we progress, we'll capture the data from the process and build shiny new project files that are much nicer expending extra effort now doesn't get you anywhere.</p>

<h2>If you run into trouble, and need help</h2>

<p>Check on IRC #coapp on freenode.net (try the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webclient</a> if you don't have IRC installed) if I'm there, I'm more than willing you help you thru the steps (and fix stuff that needs fixing), or failing that on the (mailing list)[<a href='https://launchpad.net/~coapp-developers'><a href='https://launchpad.net/~coapp-developers'>https://launchpad.net/~coapp-developers</a></a>].</p>

<h2>The Process for Shallow-Forking for CoApp packages</h2>

<p>Quick Note: This is the first iteration of the Shallow-Fork process there are a number of deeper issues when forking projects that have multiple active branches, several configurations, etc.  What we're trying to do here is lay out a common approach so that as we proceed, we can automate as much as possible over the long run.   This procedure is likely to evolve quite a bit as we account for more scenarios and add support for additional compilers, configurations and build types.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find an open source C/C++ library or application that you'd like to fork.  You can select one off the list of things that we know we really need, or something else that of particular interest to you, and for which you'd like to see a CoApp package created.  If the project that you want to build has things that it depends on, you may need to go ahead and provide the shallow-fork for that as well we do not want to rely on binary builds that someone else has provided, that would be kinda silly.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a project in Github. Depending on what you're trying to make a fork of, you're going to do this in one of a few different ways.  If the project is already on GitHub, create a fork for it in the coapp-packages organization. If the source is posted as a zip file, unpack it and create the project manually. If it's in another VCS, there may be a generally-acceptable method to creating a fork in Git.  Bottom line, get the project into Github in a project in the coapp-packages organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone the source code into your working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a folder in the root of the project called <strong>COPKG</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a text file in the folder called <strong>.buildinfo</strong> this is the file that you will be putting the build steps into. </p>

<p>The format of the .buildinfo file can be thought of something akin to a .css file.  Simple values need not be quoted (but it's ok to do so).  It supports comments ( double-slash and /* */), C# style string literals (may be preceded by an @ symbol to make a string multi-line).  </p>

<p>Inside the <strong>.buildinfo</strong> file,  insert the following: </p></li>
</ol>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>#<span class="n">product</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="n">info</span>  <span class="p">{</span>

<h3>Create one or more Build Configurations</h3>

<p>A "<strong>Build Configuration</strong>" is analogous to a build configuration with Visual Studio You can create builds for x86, x64, as well as for different flavors (static library vs. dynamic library) etc.  It's not necessary to explicitly create multiple build configuration for x86 and x64 if project compiles well under both without different commands (save for the selection of which platform).  You <strong>do</strong> want multiple configurations when the steps change between platforms (or you know that different files get processed in some libraries, there are separate files for x86 vs. x64), or if you have different expected outputs i.e. some libraries allow you to generate a static and a dynamic version of the same library).  Generally speaking, err on the side of caution and don't create multiple build configurations excessively for projects that behave themselves, we'll autogenerate the alternate configurations when we get around to creating new Visual Studio projects. </p>

<p>The build configuration syntax: </p>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p><p>It has been an extreme amount of time since I&rsquo;ve done a status update&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been working hard here, honest!&nbsp; Under a stack of what seems like a million little things, blogging has taken a backseat to development in recent months, but I&rsquo;m hoping to correct that (and have some others do some blog posts too!)</p></p>

<p align="left">As you can see, we&rsquo;re on a new site; this is powered by <a href="http://orchardproject.net/">Orchard</a>, an open source CMS for Windows.&nbsp; I chose this, primarily because it&rsquo;s built to run on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Azure</a> as well as Windows Server, and the kind folks at Microsoft have given me an Azure account with plenty of resources.&nbsp; I also spun up a <a href="http://screwturn.eu/">Screwturn</a> Wiki for documentation (it&rsquo;s what the Orchard guys use for their site, so I followed suit).&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The new site is a tad bare right now, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll get this all put together over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<h2>A new code repository</h2>

<p>As I <a href="http://fearthecowboy.com/2011/04/26/weve-moved-coapp-code-hosting-to-github/">mentioned on my blog last week</a>, we also moved our code repository over to GitHub:</p>

<ul>

<li>&nbsp; 

<ul>

<li><em>While I liked a lot of the things about Launchpad, the website is feeling slower and slower some days, and Bazaar, while offering the features that I like, isn&rsquo;t getting the attention (and developer resources) that Git is.&nbsp; Combined with the fantastic innovation happening at Github, it&rsquo;s undeniably the go-to place for open source development these days.<br /></em></li>

<li><em>And, having done some recent tests with Git on Windows, it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s stable and feature rich enough for all my purposes.</em></li>

</ul>

<p></li></p>

<p></ul></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with that I also talk about how to checkout the code and compile it up.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s still an iceberg (most of the code isn&rsquo;t about what you see) but beneath that surface there is a huge amount of functionality lurking.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>The last six months have had a flurry of code development done, including essentially the entire CoApp engine&mdash;originally we were hoping that the volunteer work by the group at the University of Syracuse would produce a functional prototype,&nbsp; it turned out to be too-aggressive of a goal.&nbsp; Consequently, the entire engine was written in three months, and diverted my attention away from other things (this site being one of them)</p>

<h4>Where we at:</h4>

<h3>CoApp Core:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>CoApp toolkit </strong>&ndash; all of CoApp&rsquo;s shared code ends up in the toolkit project. A cornucopia of functionality, it provides a tremendous amount of simple, reusable functionality that is shared across all projects.</li>

<li><strong>CoApp Engine </strong>&ndash; we have a managed version of the engine with the basic v1 functionality complete, I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s in a solid beta stage at this point.&nbsp; </li>

<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>

<li><strong>CoApp Command Line Client </strong>&ndash; the command line client works pretty good, if a tad verbose on the command line. It&rsquo;s pretty optimized for the happy-path at this point, but still a pretty good beta.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Publisher Tools:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>mkPackage</strong> &ndash; the first tool to create packages for CoApp has been working, but it turned out it took an awful lot of effort to build a package, so we&rsquo;ve depricated that, and gone back to the drawing board. The result, is Autopackage&mdash;a tool designed to do what we really wanted, which is creating packages without messy XML, no need to understand MSI or WiX, or even code signing.&nbsp; </li>

<li><strong>Autopackage</strong>&mdash;is designed to eliminate 100% of the understanding and guesswork in creating packages for consumption.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s already functional and able to produce packages, and is nearing the &lsquo;alpha&rsquo; stage.&nbsp; Eric has done an amazing amount of work in a short time to produce something that is going to get a lot of attention.</li>

<li><br /><strong>simplesigner &ndash; </strong>even simple code signing operations are a hassle in Windows, and when you add .NET strong-naming into the mix, it&rsquo;s all a little difficult to get a hold of, so I wrote the simplesigner tool.. It does exactly what it says, <em>makes digital signing software </em>on Windows <strong>simple</strong>.&nbsp; For .NET executable binaries, it both signs and strong-names the result, and eliminates the guesswork and frustration entirely. </li>

<li></li>

</ul>

<h3>Developer Tools:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Scan</strong>&mdash;Trevor knocked out the first beta of this tool way back in October,&nbsp; It does exactly as I&lsquo;d hoped, a very useful scan of a source tree, and brings back a very large amount of useful data.&nbsp; On top of it&rsquo;s use as part of mkSpec, it&rsquo;s also quite handy on it&rsquo;s own to get an idea of what a project uses, and how it all fits together. Solid 1.0 material.</li>

<li><br /><strong>Trace</strong>&mdash;The ultimate evolution of my original 32 bit trace utility, Rafael and I have put an insane amount of work into this tool.&nbsp; Trace can watch a program, and all of its child processes and record every single file access (and <em>how </em>it was accessed), and record the environment, and command lines for every process.&nbsp; It works for nearly every type of application we&rsquo;ve thrown at it: 32bit, 64bit, .NET, cygwin, native&hellip; The data it gets back is extremely valuable&mdash;we use it primarily to feed into the mkSpec tool to produce project files, but it has a lot of use on it&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; It even captures some data that you can&rsquo;t get from Sysinternals&rsquo; ProcMon. We&rsquo;re pretty much 1.0 gold here. <br /><br /><strong>mkSpec</strong>&mdash;The tool that generates a &lsquo;compiler-independent&rsquo; project file from scan and trace data.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s getting really close to beta stage&mdash;I just need to leverage the latest trace info and we should be on our way.<br /><br /><strong>mkProject</strong> &ndash; the secret sauce of the entire CoApp project.&nbsp; mkProject takes project info from mkSpec and produces Visual Studio project files that are consistent, clean and support easy use of advanced features like PGO optimization, etc.&nbsp; Still a work in progress&mdash;probably a few weeks away from a beta.</li>

<li><strong>testpackagemaker &ndash; </strong>development of the package manager requires a lot of testing examples, and this tool simplifies the generation of native and .NET executables and libraries that support side-by-side so we can build packages for testing. Solid 1.0 stuff here.</li>

<li><br /><strong>pTk </strong>&ndash; a recent addition to the CoApp developer tool lineup, pTk (aka the <strong><em>porting Toolkit</em></strong>)&nbsp; is a build automation tool (no, not like make or msbuild).&nbsp; pTk provides a method for package maintainers to express &lsquo;how-to-build&rsquo; a given project so that the process can be automated by other tools without understanding anything about the build whatsoever (this will let us automate the trace/mkSpec/mkProject process <strong>*a lot*.</strong>)&nbsp; Rather than having the package maintainer/developer express a build process in its terms, it simply is a way of letting the developer write down the commands to build a given project (as a command, or batch script, or whatever) and provides an automatable wrapper for that.&nbsp; This is definitely release candidate material.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Productivity Tools:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>quicktool </strong>&ndash; During development, it&rsquo;s always so useful to share code, screenshots etc. when working remotely (either live, via Skype, Lync or IRC) or even via Twitter or email. quicktool provides a system-wide hot-key to uploading images, formatted source snippets, and shortening URLs without having to bring up a separate tool or browser to do so.&nbsp; Faster and more convenient than clumsy websites like pastebin, it allows developers to easily share information at a single keypress.</li>

<li></li>

</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s about it for today&hellip; over the next few days I&rsquo;ll be posting some tutorials (ie, how to shallow fork a Project for CoApp) and some more information on how you can get involved if you&rsquo;re inclined.</p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>I recently moved the CoApp source repositories from Launchpad to github, and I wanted make sure that I preserved all the commit history along with it. Fortunately, it's not too terribly difficult to move from one to the other (provided you jump thru the hoops to getting fast-import working on bzr for Windows).</p>

<h2>Fixing Bzr for Windows</h2>

<p>Bzr on Windows supports fast import-except that the installer doesn't install the fast-import python module when it installs python.  Easy enough to fix. You need to grab a copy of the <strong>fast-import</strong> module from launchpad:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\tmp<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">bzr</span> clone lp:python-fastimport
Connected (version <span class="m">2</span>.<span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> client Twisted)
Authentication (publickey) successful!
Secsh channel <span class="m">1</span> opened.
Branched <span class="m">301</span> revision(s).
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>And then combine it with the library.zip file that's already in the Bazaar install directory using zip (I used the command line zip utility from infozip)...</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\tmp<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">cd</span> python-fastimport

C:\tmp\python-fastimport<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">zip</span> -r <span class="s2">&quot;c:\Program Files (x86)\Bazaar\lib\library.zip&quot;</span> *
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>Once you've done that, it's really trivial to move a .bzr repository to a git one:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\tmp<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">mkdir</span> someproject

C:\tmp<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">cd</span> someproject

C:\tmp\someproject<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">git</span> init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:<span class="n">/tmp/someproject/.git/</span>

C:\tmp\someproject<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">bzr</span> fast-export --plain YOUR-BZR-REPO <span class="p">|</span> <span class="n">git</span> fast-import
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>Where <strong>YOUR-BZR-REPO</strong> is the path to your bazaar repository - it can be a path to a local repo, or a remote location (like, lp:projectname).</p>

<p>It will spit out some information, and then you need to:</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\tmp\someproject<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">git</span> checkout master
Already <span class="k">on</span> <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>Now, you've got a shiny new git repo from your bazaar repo, and you can play with it as you will.</p> </div>

    <div id="post" class="post"> <p>Just a quick update today - we've moved the source repositories for CoApp from <a href="https://launchpad.net/coapp">Launchpad</a> to <a href="https://github.com/coapp">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>While I liked a lot of the things about Launchpad, the website is feeling slower and slower some days, and Bazaar, while offering the features that I like, isn't getting the attention (and developer resources) that Git is. Combined with the fantastic innovation happening at GitHub, it's undeniably the go-to place for open source development these days.</p>

<p>And, having done some recent tests with git on Windows, it's clear that it's stable and feature rich enough for all my purposes.</p>

<h2>Updated for use on Github</h2>

<p>The following is the instructions on how to build the current CoApp bits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to have the following tools installed in order to build CoApp:</p>

<ul><li>Visual Studio 2010 (I'm told that VS 2010 Express will work)    </li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279">Windows SDK 7.0</a> or higher    </li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11800">Windows WDK 7.1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a> - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.4-preview20110204.exe">Git for Windows 1.7.4</a> or higher. (This is a command line Git client - there are also other GUIs available.) </li>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a> (&amp; Pageant) - get the putty-0.60-installer.exe</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="label warning">Warning</span> I had issues with the SSH client in msysgit; you may need to run the command (assuming that Plink is installed in your <code>PATH</code> somewhere):</p>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\coapp&gt; SET GIT_SSH=PLINK.EXE
</pre></div>

<p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create and account for GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>Run Pageant, load your private key.</p></li>
<li><p>Download the following script: <a href="https://github.com/downloads/fearthecowboy/coapp/coapp-src.cmd">coapp-src.cmd</a></p></li>
<li><p>Unzip the script into your working directory (where you want to check out the source to)</p></li>
<li><p>From the command line:</p></li>
</ul>



<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>C:\coapp&gt; coapp-src

  Usage:
  ------
  coapp-src.cmd [OPTION]

  where [OPTION] is one or more of:

      core        - just the core projects to build the package manager
      gui         - the prototype work on the GUI client
      tools       - the developer and publisher tools
      guts        - the guts of the bootstrap and installershim
      other       - garrett&#39;s other tools and oddities
      all         - all of the above

      update      - merges updates for any projects that are already checked out.

   You can check out a portion of the code (or all, if you want) by using the script:

  C:\coapp&gt; coapp-src core
</pre></div>

<p>

<p>It will check out just the core (coapp-cli, coapp-toolkit and coapp-solution).</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the coapp-solution\coapp-tools.sln solution file in Visual Studio 2010.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you didn't get all of the projects, you'll see an error when visual studio tries to load projects that are not checked out; this is ok, you can ignore the error (or delete the projects that are missing from your solution file).</p>

<ul>
<li>Build it. (CTRL-SHIFT-B)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you build the debug version, you won't be able to build the release (you'd need my private cert, and it does some funky stuff during the build process).</p>

<ul>
<li>The output will be in [root]\output\any\debug\bin:</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/output-any-debug-bin-dir.png" alt="Dir listing" title="" /></span></p>

<p>And you should be able to run the coapp.exe in that directory:</p>

<p><span class="scrollcontainer"><img src="/images/blog/coapp-list-packages.png" alt="Dir listing" title="" /></span></p>

<p>You'll notice the packages that I installed from the <a href='http://coapp.org'><a href='http://coapp.org'>http://coapp.org</a></a> website are installed.</p>

<p>All CoApp binaries (except for the bootstrapper itself) are built as 'any' (meaning they will run 64bit on x64 systems, and 32bit on x86  systems).</p> </div>
